# Fractal

Fractal is a project that generates visually captivating and intricate fractal patterns in the form of trees. This project aims to create aesthetically pleasing and random fractal structures that resemble the branching patterns found in trees.

The generated fractals exhibit self-similarity, meaning that the patterns repeat at various scales within the structure. Each tree-like fractal is unique and visually stunning, showcasing the beauty of mathematical complexity.

The project utilizes mathematical algorithms and recursive processes to generate the branching patterns of the fractals. By defining certain parameters, such as the number of branches, angles, and lengths, the program creates intricate tree-like structures with a natural and organic appearance.
